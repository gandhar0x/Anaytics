### **Formula-Heavy Units (6, 7, 8, 9, 13)**

**Unit 6: Percentage**
*   **Successive Change:** If a value changes by $x\%$ and then $y\%$, the **net change** is $[x + y + (xy/100)]\%$.
*   **Price and Consumption:** If the price increases by $P\%$, reduce consumption by $[P / (100 + P)] \times 100\%$ to keep expenditure constant.
*   **Comparison:** If A is $x\%$ more than B, B is less than A by $[x / (100 + x)] \times 100\%$.

**Unit 7: Profit and Loss**
*   **Basics:** Profit = $SP - CP$; Loss = $CP - SP$; Percentage is always calculated on **Cost Price (CP)**.
*   **The Article Trick:** If the CP of $m$ items equals the SP of $n$ items, $\%$ Gain/Loss = $[(m - n) / n] \times 100$.
*   **Successive Discount:** For two discounts $m\%$ and $n\%$, the equivalent single discount is $[m + n - (mn/100)]\%$.
*   **Dishonest Dealer:** $\%$ Gain = $[\text{Error} / (\text{True Value} - \text{Error})] \times 100$.

**Unit 8: Simple Interest (SI)**
*   **Standard Formula:** $SI = (P \times R \times T) / 100$.
*   **Amount (A):** $A = P[1 + (RT/100)]$.
*   **Solving Trick:** If a sum **doubles** itself in $T$ years, the rate $R = 100/T$.

**Unit 9: Compound Interest (CI)**
*   **Amount Formula:** $A = P(1 + R/100)^n$.
*   **Intervals:** For **half-yearly**, use $R/2$ and $2n$; for **quarterly**, use $R/4$ and $4n$.
*   **SI/CI Difference (2 Years):** $CI - SI = P(R/100)^2$.

**Unit 13: Direction Sense Test**
*   **Shortest Distance:** Use the **Pythagorean Theorem**: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
*   **Shadow Trick:** At **sunrise**, shadows are always West; at **sunset**, shadows are always East.
*   **Clockwise/Anticlockwise:** Calculate net degrees (e.g., $165^\circ \text{ anti} - 120^\circ \text{ clock} = 45^\circ \text{ anti}$) before drawing.

### **Logic and Common Sense Units (1-5, 10, 11, 12, 14)**

**Unit 1: Number System**
*   **Divisibility:** 3 (sum of digits), 4 (last two digits), 11 (difference of sums of odd/even places is 0 or 11).
*   **Multiplying by 9/99/999:** Add zeros equal to the number of 9s and subtract the original number.

**Unit 2: Average**
*   **Consecutive Numbers:** The average of an Arithmetic Progression (AP) is simply the **middle term** (if $n$ is odd) or the average of the two middle terms (if $n$ is even).
*   **Shortcut:** Average of consecutive numbers = $(1st \text{ term} + \text{last term}) / 2$.

**Unit 3 & 4: Number and Alphabet Series**
*   **Series Logic:** Always check the **difference** between terms first. If differences are constant, it’s Arithmetic; if they grow rapidly, check Ratios or Squares/Cubes.
*   **EJOTY Trick:** Memorise positions **5, 10, 15, 20, 25** for E, J, O, T, Y to locate any letter quickly.

**Unit 5: Coding-Decoding**
*   **Comparison:** If "pit dar na" is "you are good" and "dar tok pa" is "good and bad," the common word "dar" must be "good".

**Unit 10 & 11: Alphabet and Number Test**
*   **Preceded vs Followed:** "Preceded by" means the item **before**; "Followed by" means the item **after**.
*   **Dictionary Order:** Arrange words letter by letter.

**Unit 12: Ranking**
*   **Total Count:** $\text{Total} = (\text{Rank from Left} + \text{Rank from Right}) - 1$.
*   **Position Shift:** To find a new rank after interchanging, find the increase in the first person's rank and add it to the second person's initial rank.

**Unit 14: Blood Relation**
*   **Family Tree:** Use **horizontal lines** for same-generation (siblings), **vertical lines** for different generations (parents/children), and **plus/minus** signs to denote gender.
*   **Logic:** "Only son of my grandfather" is "My Father". Always identify the gender of the final subject before choosing an option.
